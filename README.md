## Overview

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- segment the image by using rough k-mean algorithm

## My process

- Take an image
- Take number of cluster
- Take threshold value ( range between 0 to 1 )
-	Generate random centre where no. of centre = no. of cluster.
-	Randomly generate Wupper and Wlower where Wupper + Wlower = 1.
-	Apply Rough k-means clustering algorithm.
-	Based on cluster centre generate segmented image.

### Built with

- MATLAB
